      <p>Playing this game totallly helped me to make it through a lot of hard things in my life</p>

      <h2>Why is life is strange so important to me?</h2>
      <p>LiS was released in 2015. On that date, my life was a little bit complicated</p>
      <p>because my country was just starting a dictatorship. I was really young and it was a</p>
      <p>huge shock to me. Also, I was discovering myself</p>

        <h3>Other Square Enix's games</h3>
        <p>LSquare Enix's is the creator of this game. They have created several other games, included but not limited LiS series, including LiS 2 and 3.</p>
        <p>As well as some known games as Final Fantasy Saga, Forspoken, Valkyrie, Kingdom hearts, I am Setsuna, among others.</p>
        <p>The last Lis eposide was released on March 18, 2021. True Colors is a must-play. If you liked previous entries in the Life is Strange series,</p>
        <p> you'll probably enjoy this one. It's a tighter, cleaner take on the formula, but at its heart, 
        <p> it's still the balance of magic and mundane that's become signature to these games.</p>
